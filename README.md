# Playpoint

![](documentation/images/amiresponsive-playpoint.png)

## Introduction

Playpoint is a website that aims to keep users informed about the latest game releases through community interaction. The webiste allows users to write game reviews, comment on other users game reviews as well as create and update their own personal profile. 

I developed this website as part of the Code Instituteâ€™s Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp course and it is my final Hackathon project - focusing on a Django framework, database manipulation, CRUD functionality, and working as a team using agile methodologies. This project is for educational purposes only.

## Overview

Playpoint is a website designed to keep users informed of the latest game releases and allow for general discussion between users. Users are invited to:

- Join the Playpoint community
- create an account and update your profile.
- Interact with review posts through the comments section

Playpoint is accessible via all browsers with full responsiveness on different screen sizes. My aim is to create a space where users can read about upcoming events and provide comments about their own experiences. The goal of the site is to support these events and drive customers to them where possible via positive event posts.

## UX - User Experience

### Colour Scheme

The idea of the website is to have reviews posted for people to view. The colour scheme used was to create a modern and minimal design.

the colour for the header is Dark Grey rgb(47, 47, 47)

The colour throughout the entire website is white (#f9fafc)

font colour is normal black and white, with certain text (i.e navbar) having a cyan (#10B981) colour when hovered over.

### Font

The font style I used throughout the entire website was Exo

![screenshot of exo font](documentation/images/font-used.png)

## Project Planning

### Strategy Plane

My project goal was to build a simple website showcasing game reviews with the option to have a dynamic conversation about the game using the comments section. My intention is to create a community/hub for gamers to openly express and share their thoughts on a partciular game.

### Site Goals

- Create an environment where people could discuss video games through reviews and comments.
- Easy UI for quick fulfilment of feature CRUD functionalities.
- UX remains the same whether on mobile, tablet, or desktop.

## Agile Methodologies - Project Management

Playpoint is my third project following Agile planning methods. I used the [GitHub Projects Board](https://github.com/users/Yazhmd/projects/3/views/1) to plan and document all my work.

![screenshot of Project board](documentation/images/projectboard.png)


### MoSCoW Prioritization

I chose to follow the MoSCoW Prioritization method for Playpoint, identifying and labelling the:

- **Must Haves**: The 'required', critical components of the project. Completing my 'Must Haves' helped me reach the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this project early, allowing me to develop further than originally planned.
- **Should Haves**: Components that are valuable to the project but not absolutely 'vital' at the MVP stage. The 'Must Haves' must receive priority over the 'Should Haves'.
- **Could Haves**: Features that are a 'bonus' to the project; it would be nice to have them in this phase, but only if the most important issues have been completed first and time allows.
- **Won't Haves**: Features or components that either no longer fit the project's brief or are of very low priority for this release.

## User Stories

User stories and features recorded and managed on my [GitHub Projects Board](https://github.com/users/Yazhmd/projects/3/views/1).

## Scope Plane

As I would be both learning/building the project using technologies that were still relatively new to me, such as Django, SQL, Bootstrap, and Cloudinary, I remianed cautious to maintain consistent control over the scope of the project and not let the idea become too overly cumbersome. I needed to finish project features early so as not to lose track of the MVP. Following Agile Planning Methodologies, I added User Stories as issues on my GitHub Project Board to keep the flow of the project in check.

Essential features of my project were:

- An accessible website that fulfills user needs
- Responsive website for users of mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- User Authentication, sign in and registration
- Review, Comment and profile feature with full CRUD functionality

Planning thoroughly from the start allowed me to identify areas of importance for MVP completion and satisfaction of assessment criteria while balancing them with feature feasibility.

## Structural Plane

From initial concept through to the finalised project, I opted to use standard navigation elements to keep with the theme of familiarity. Bootstrap was used to help control flexibility across multiple screen sizes.

## Skeleton & Surface Planes

### Logo and Hero images

![Playpoint Logo](documentation/images/logo_white_full_playpoint-removebg-preview.png)

This was made using Design.com, the design of the playpoint logo is a simple joystick which is consitent with the gaming theme and colour that were chosen to make the logo visually appealing.

#### Main hero image

![Main ](documentation/images/Game_covers_background_hero.jpg)

The main hero image is from (https://www.indiamart.com/proddetail/pc-game-22881473891.html).
I liked the design of this image as it definitley gave a gaiming aesthetic with multiple game cover arts featured on the jumbotron. 

#### Secondary hero image

![second](documentation/images/Hero_image_characters-removebg-preview.webp)

The secondary hero image, down on the about section in the main homepage, is from (https://www.reddit.com/r/IrelandGaming/comments/14nvix3/what_video_game_franchise_would_make_you/). This reddit post I found had these ideal image that I decided I wanted to use. It has iconic game characters that adds to the general them of the website that I liked.

### Wireframes

The wireframes for Playpoint were made using Balsamiq. This gave me a rough idea when making each individual feature and page.

Wireframes created for:

- Main homepage
- Review library
- Review detail post
- Profile page

### Database Schema - Entity Relationship Diagram

![ERD Image](documentation/images/ERD-diagram.png)

_Database Schema (ERD) for Playpoint displaying relationships between feature components saved within the database._

This Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) demonstrates how each feature interacts with each other and connects with PostgreSQL Database. Using Django's User Model along with Django AllAuth for user authentication allows me to create a user_id when they register with their username and email. This enables users to add and edit reviews/comments which will display their username as well as in their profile.

The User, Post, and Comments Models were inspired by Daisy's recipe blog tutorial and Code Institute's blog walkthroughs which helped me grasp templating structures alongside connected Python files.


### Review model

The review model allows the user to create a review where they are able to add the title, genre, game platform/conosle, image and their thoughts on the review summernotte text field. After all that they can add a score (final verdict) of the game form 1-10.

### Comment model

The comment model allows the user to interact with other users reviews/posts and start a general discussion, this allows more user intereaction and contributes to the community based nature of the project. 


### Custom model: Profile model

The profile model was designed with the intention to allow users to have a more personalised expereince when using the website (adding in Personal deatils, bio and profile picture) and also extending the allauth features of Django.

### Search feature

With the help of the Daisy recipe blog tutorial, I was also able to impliment a search feature that allows user to view specific games they are interested in seeing reviews for based on, the name, console and platform.


### Security

A number of security steps were taken in this project in order to protect submitted data. Unlike strictly informative websites, Playpoint allows users to become part of a community by creating comments/reviews and interacting with them. To meet strict internet standards regarding data protection, I included several processes during development:

**AllAuth**

Django AllAuth is an installable framework that takes care of user registration and authentication processes. Authentication was needed to determine when users were registered or unregistered while controlling who could add comments.

The setup process included:

1. Installing it into my workspace dependencies.
2. Adding it into INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.
3. Sourcing AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS from Codestar walkthrough for settings.py.
4. Adding its URL into my project's 'urls.py'.
5. Running database migrations needed for AllAuth tables.
6. For this version of Playpoint, email and social accounts were not configured as part of feedback/sign-up options.

**Defensive Design**

I developed Playpoint ensuring smooth user experience based on current learning experiences with Django:

1. Input validation provides feedback guiding users towards desired outcomes.
2. Authentication processes control edit/delete icons visible only to post/comment authors.
3. Deletion confirmation through an additional modal prompts double-checking from users.
4. Testing validates features throughout development.

**CSRF Tokens**

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens are included in every form submission helping authenticate requests with servers when forms are submitted; absence leaves sites vulnerable.

## Features

### User View - Registered/Unregistered

It was important from early stages that Playpoint be accessible even for unregistered users; showcasing user reviews and comments.

accessibility citeria:

| Feature        | Unregistered User               | Registered, Logged-In User |
|----------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Review Library | Visible                         | Visible                    |
| Review post    | Visible                         | Visible                    |
| Comments       | Visible but unable to add/amend | Fully interactive          |

### CRUD Functionality

Users can Create, Read, Update, or Delete shared information on Playpoint; some features offer full CRUD functionality while others present necessary options only:

| Feature      | Create                     | Read | Update                      | Delete                                                               |

## Future Features

- **Add game wish list**: Allowing users to compile all the games that they would like to play in the future based on reviews that they have read.

- **Adding labels, tags and context processes**: This can make the process of adding genres to a game that is being reviewed more easy without having the user manually having to do it.

- **Like and Dislike Button**: Allowing users to like and dislike both reviews and comments

- **password reset and forgot password**: Allow users to change and recover their passwords

- **Other users profile view**: Being able to view other users profiles and see all the personal reviews that they havve made.

# Testing & Validation

- for all testing, validation and any other bugs, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

# Bugs

- One major bug I encountered was with my env.py as I accidently pushed it into one of my commits. However, with the help of John Rearden (coding coach) I was able to rectify this by creating a new env.py and generating both a new cludinary APi key and a Postgresql database using the CI database maker as well as creating a new secret key so that this new env.py will not get pushed and any security problems will not occur. The env.py that is shown publically on the repository is no longer active as I have removed it and is no longer in use.

# Django Project Setup

## Install Django

1. Run the following command to install Django:
   pip3 install Django~=4.2.1
   text

2. Create a Requirements File

- Generate a `requirements.txt` file that lists your project's dependencies:
  pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
  text

3. Create a New Django Project

- Replace `project_name` with the desired project name. Donâ€™t forget the `.` at the end of the command:
  django-admin startproject project_name .
  text

4. Apply Pre-Built Django Account Migrations

- Run the following command to apply Djangoâ€™s default migrations:
  python3 manage.py migrate
  text

5. Run the Development Server

- Start the server to test your project:
  python3 manage.py runserver
  text
- If you see a yellow error screen, itâ€™s because Django doesnâ€™t recognize the hostname your project is running on. Follow the next step to fix this.

6. Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS`

- Copy the hostname displayed in the error message (e.g., `'8000-nielmc-django-project-0kylrta3cs.us2.codeanyapp.com'`).
- Add the hostname to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list in your `settings.py` file:
  ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['8000-nielmc-django-project-0kylrta3cs.us2.codeanyapp.com']
  text

7. Add CSRF Trusted Origins

- Below the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` variable, add:
  CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ['https://.codeinstitute-ide.net', 'https://.herokuapp.com']
  text

## Creating an App

1. Create a new Django app. Replace `app_name` with the desired app name:
   python3 manage.py startapp app_name
   text

2. Add the app to `INSTALLED_APPS`

- Open your `settings.py` file and add the app name to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:
  INSTALLED_APPS = [
  ...
  'app_name',
  ]
  text

## Create Necessary Folders

1. Create the following folders in the top-level directory:
   mkdir media static templates
   text

2. Install WhiteNoise

- Run the following command:
  pip3 install whitenoise~=5.3.0
  text

3. Freeze requirements:
   pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
   text

4. Update `MIDDLEWARE` in `settings.py`

- Add WhiteNoise after `SecurityMiddleware`:
  MIDDLEWARE = [
  'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
  'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
  ...,
  ]
  text

## Prerequisites Before Deploying to Heroku

1. Install Gunicorn:
   pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1
   text

2. Update `requirements.txt`:
   pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
   text

3. Create a `Procfile` (no file extension, capitalize P):
   echo "web: gunicorn project_name.wsgi" > Procfile
   text

4. Add the deployed appâ€™s URL to `ALLOWED_HOSTS`:

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourprojecturl.herokuapp.com']
```

## Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

1. Install database packages:

```
pip3 install dj-database-url~=0.5 psycopg
```

2. Update `requirements.txt`:

```
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

3. Create `env.py` and add it to `.gitignore`:

```
import os

os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "<PostgreSQL URL>"
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<YourSecretKey>"
```

4. Update `settings.py`:

```
from pathlib import Path
import os
import dj_database_url

if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
    import env

SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}
```

5. Run migrations:

```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

6. Create a superuser:

```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Cloudinary

1. Install required packages:

```
pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage~=0.0.6 urllib3~=1.26.15
```

2. Update `requirements.txt`:

```
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

3. Add Cloudinary URL to `env.py`:

```
os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://<API Key>"
```

4. Update `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'cloudinary_storage',
    'cloudinary',
    ...,
]
```

5. Configure static files in `settings.py`:

```
STATIC_URL = 'static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
```

6. Set up templates directory in `settings.py`:

```
TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')

TEMPLATES = [
    {
        ...,
        'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],
        ...,
    },
]
```

## Deploying to Heroku

1. Log in to Heroku and create a new app.
2. Add Config Vars in Heroku Settings:

```
DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1
SECRET_KEY = <YourSecretKey>
DATABASE_URL = <PostgreSQL URL>
CLOUDINARY_URL = cloudinary://<API Key>
text
```

3. Connect to your GitHub repository from Heroku.
4. Deploy the app from the Heroku dashboard.

## Git Branching

Git branching was used to make sure that I could have somewhat of a non-destrcutive workflow only relaising this after my second resubmission which is when I decide to impliment it. This would ensure that if something broke the website, it would only exit on the branch that I was working, not affecting the main branch.

Creating a new branch

- Create a new LOCAL branch to work with, so we're not working directly on the main branch.

```
    git checkout -b newBranchName

    git switch -c newBranchName
```
  Working on the new branch adding and committing as we go.

You will want to occasionally push the new branch to the REMOTE in case anything goes wrong with your LOCAL workspace, like
internet connection problems or the cat chews your keyboard etc. The first time you push a new branch we have to let the REMOTE
know it exists as follows:

```
 git push --set-upstream origin newBranchName
```

Git Merging process

```
1.git checkout main - to switch to your local main branch

2. git pull - to pull any changes to your local main branch from the remote GitHub main branch

3. git checkout <working branch> - to switch to your local working branch

4. git merge main - to merge any changes in your local main branch to your local working branch

5. git push - to push your local working branch changes to your remote GitHub working branch
```
6. Go to the GitHub repo
7. Select your branch from Branch drop down
8. Select the Contribute button to Open pull request
9. Click Create pull request and follow pull request procedure
